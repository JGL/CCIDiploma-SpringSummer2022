  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine, I'll message on the chat when the meditation is over.</div>
  <div>Before we get into the lecture, I just wanted to go through the schedule of assessment up to the end of the year. Because of the Platinum Jubilee we've decided to have the multiple choice a little earlier to leave more time for preparation for the practical exam. The multiple choice will be live from Tuesday 24th May 2022 at 0900 to Tuesday 31st May at 0900. The practical exam will be live from Monday 6th June 2022 at 0900 to Monday 13th June at 0900. I'm still going to teach more app development on Tuesday 24th May and Tuesday 31st May.
