  <div>CCI Diploma 2021/2022: Unit 4: Lecture 12.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine, I'll message on the chat when the meditation is over.</div>
  <div>Let's start by going through <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2022#assessment">last year's practical exam and mock</a>. I've prepared an example passing app for both. Pay particular attention to the Apple documentation around <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/">UIView</a>. How do we access the UIView that makes up the whole screen? How do we access the UIView that shows the colour preview? What other things can we do to a UIView? Pay attention to the references that are given to you in the exam PDF!</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look through student submissions from last year that got A+, A, B and C grades respectively. What can you take from these grades? Does it make you think differently about what to do? How did the C student compare to the A+?</div>
  <div>Next, I'd like to make sure you know how to make a .zip file of the folder of your xCode project - last year a few students had to do resits because they only submitted a single .swift file or just the .xcodeproj file. What have you learnt from this? What will you do differently as a result?</div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me? I can keep going through the book, up until the end, or we can have a general discussion. This is my last ever lecture on the CCI Diploma. You are all Diplomats now. Don't hestitate to get in contact if I can ever help you with: references, internships, jobs, advice, jokes etc. You can always get in contact via my website: <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com">https://joelgethinlewis.com</a>. Thank you. 🙇🏻🖖🏻🛹🐟🦆</div>
